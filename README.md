Fun game created using JavaScript code with appropriate event handling functions and HTML DOM manipulation. The goal is to detect and click on the extra smiling face on the left half of the page. At each level, the user is presented with a number of identical smiley faces on the left half and right half of the page, with the left half having one face more than the right. If the user is successful in picking the extra face on the left, he/she progresses on to the next level and the process repeats, but with more faces than before. Thus, it becomes harder as the level increases and on the other hand, if at any level the user clicks on the wrong face or anywhere else on the body, he/she loses the game!
